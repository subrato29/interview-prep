* Skipping a test method : throw new SkipException("Skipping the test for some reason");

TestNG Listeners:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are Listeners in TestNG : -

In TestNG we can generate logs with the help of Listeners. 
Listeners implement the interface "org.testng.ITestListener". 
There are methods which gives you a real time information.

By using TestNG listeners 'ITestListener' or 'TestListenerAdapter' we can change the default behaviour write our own implementation 
when a Test fails or Skips etc.

OnTestStart : Invoked each time before a test will be invoked.

OnTestSuccess : Invoked each time a test succeeds.

OnTestFailure : Invoked each time a test fails
We can implement any logic that you want to do when a test fails, Normally most of them prefer taking screen shots when a test fails. Here in this method we can add a logic to take the screen shot and the name of the test as screenshot name.

OnTestSkipped : Invoked each time a test is skipped.

OnTestFinish : Invoked after all the tests have run and all their Configuration methods have been called.
